Hi there 👋, I'm Saikat Das Sajib!  
  
🎓 I'm a PhD Candidate at UiT-The Arctic University of Norway, diving deep into breast cancer metastasis.

🔬 While my roots are in biochemistry and molecular biology, I've grown a passion for bioinformatics, especially in next generation sequencing data analysis.

🔍 My research involves not only computational analysis but also wet lab techniques, bridging the traditional gap and pushing boundaries in both fields.

🔧 Technologies & Tools I use:
R and a bit of Python

📈 I'm always looking for new challenges, especially ones that allow me to explore new territories in bioinformatics.
